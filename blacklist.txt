# Managed by AppGate – changes from the CLI overwrite this file automatically.
# List of IP addresses to block (one per line)
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored.
# Each entry can be one of:
#   <ip> all            # block every port for the IP
#   <ip> 80 443 8443    # block just the listed TCP/UDP ports
# Keywords all/any/* are equivalent when listing ports.

# Example IPv4 and IPv6 entries (uncomment to use):
# 8.8.8.8 all
# 1.1.1.1 80 443
# 2606:4700:4700::1111
